## Introduction

>WATCH-emr-and-gases-detection project includes several function added on smart_watch. First, it can detect electric wires by hall_sensor. And also can chect oxygen consentration around smart_watch by o2_sensor. So the following project offers code work of function above.

## Developement Environment

- STM32CUBEMX

* Step 4. Save as CubeMX project (Project name: Watch) in "stm-watch" folder
* Step 5. Click "Generate code" button
* Step 6. Delete main.h file in "Watch/Inc/" and main.c file "Watch/Src/"
* Step 7. Create/init local git repository in "stm-watch" folder
* Step 8. Set git origin "https://github.com/icns-distributed-cloud/safety-watch"
* Step 9. Git pull origin master

## 2. Project development
